# Even-Odd Number.

> Even numbers are those numbers that are exactly divisible by 2. The remainder operator % gives the remainder when used with a number. For example, const number = 6; const result = number % 4; // 2. Hence, when % is used with 2, the number is even if the remainder is zero. Otherwise, the number is odd.

 __Let's say__  ->

* document.write("This is even number");
for(var a = 1; a <= 10; a++) {
  if (a % 2 == 0) {
    document.write(a);
 }
}
---
* document.write("This is odd number");
  for(var a = 1; a <= 10; a++){
    if (a % 2 != 0) {
      document.write(a);
    }
  }
