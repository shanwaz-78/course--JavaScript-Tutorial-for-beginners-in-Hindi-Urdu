# Let's Learn Loop.

> JavaScript Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met. When developers talk about iteration or iterating over, say, an array, it is the same as looping.

* Like ->

             /*var Name = prompt("What is Your Name ?");
         console.log(Name);*/

       var s = 1;
       while(s <= 10){
        console.log("This is While loop");
        s = s+1;
       }

         var x = 20;
         var z = 10;

        x += z;
         console.log(x);
      
      var a = 1;
      do{
        console.log("This is do loop");
        a = a+1;
      }while(a <= 10);

      for(var a = 1; a <= 10; a++){
        document.write("This is for loop");
      }

      document.write("This is nested loop<br>");
      for(var a = 1; a <= 100; a = a+10){
        for(var b = a; b < a+10; b++){
          document.write(b + " ");
        }
        document.write("<br>");
      }
